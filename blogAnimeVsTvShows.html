            <h2>Anime Vs TV Shows</h2>

        <h3>Which is better Anime or TV Shows?</h3>
        <p>
        As some of you might not know what anime is or might still think of
        it as kids cartoon show lets see what it really is
        </p>
        <h4>What is Anime?</h4>
        <p>
        So first of all let me make it clear to you that anime is not a kids
        cartoon show or some "animated" TV show.
        <br />
        <br />
            <div class="hero-img-container">

    </div>
</div>
        <strong
            >Anime is unique and innovative style of storytelling originated
            in Japan</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br>
        In animes characters aren't bound by human limits and story doesn't
        have to be constrained by the thought of human limitation.
        <br />
        Its simply represent the different spectrum of imagination and
        unique way of presenting it.
        </p>
        <h4>How Anime is different ?</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
            In general most of the animation will have <strong>one unique concept of
            power source </strong> for eg.
            <ul>
            <li>- Devil Fruit in One piece.</li>
            <li>- Nen ability in Hunter x Hunter</li>
            <li>- Alchemy in Full Metal Alchemist</li>
            <li>- Chakra in Naruto</li>
            <li>- Cursed energy in jujutsu kaise</li>
            <li>- ki or chi in Dragon Ball</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and it goes on like this.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Action will be Limitless</strong> - It doesn't need to be bounded by laws
            of physics
        </li>
        <li><strong>Diversity of Character Class.</strong></li>
        <li>
            <strong>creativity at highest level</strong> - Each anime is unique in some form
            and represents writers creativity of thoughts
        </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="hero-img-container">
            <div class="hero-img">
                <img src="/images/676103.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Which is better ?</h3>
        <p>In my opinion anime is way ahead of general TV Shows, It has better and unique way of storytelling. Stories can be as good as writers imagination without any boundation. Its powerpacked with emotions, action and comedy.</p>
        <ul>

            <li>It has unbeatable comedy</li>
            <li>Astonishing visuals</li>
            <li>They talk about serious life lessons</li>
            <li>It represents why friendship should be valued and treasured.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>
            At the end i'll recommend you to watch at least one anime series in your life and then decide for yourself which one is better.
        </strong>
